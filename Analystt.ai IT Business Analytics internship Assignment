The Solution for this Internship Assignment:-

1. Web Scraping with hcaptcha:

Use services like 2Captcha or Anti-Captcha which offer solutions to bypass such captchas.
Consider using a headless browser like Puppeteer which can simulate real user interactions and potentially bypass the captcha.

2. Estimating Income Range from LinkedIn Profiles:

LinkedIn does not provide income information. However, you could estimate it based on factors like job title, industry, location, and years of experience.
Use salary information from websites like Glassdoor or Payscale for estimation.

3. Finding LinkedIn Company Links:

You could use LinkedIn’s search functionality to find company pages.
LinkedIn’s API might also be useful but it has usage limits and requires approval.

4. Identifying Companies Using Python:

Websites like Stackshare.io allow you to see what tech stack companies are using.
Some companies known for using Python include Google, Facebook, Spotify, Netflix, and Dropbox.

5. Sending LinkedIn Messages via API:

LinkedIn’s API does not currently support sending messages.
Automating this process might violate LinkedIn’s terms of service.
